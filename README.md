I have two dataset 
one is credit card dataset for fraud detection, This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. The data has been anonymized by the result of a PCA transformation to protect the cardholders' identities.
another is Credit Card Customer Data - This different dataset of Credit Card Transactions is provided with various features.
On Credit Card Customer Data I Applied k-means clustering to segment customers based on their transaction behaviour and profiles and also determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow method
